title: Using MC+
---

### Users

The MC+ framework can be used by anyone involved in the delivery of AI systems for documenting their work. The three cards are designed to be used independently with different audiences in mind. Table 2 suggests the types of people that each card could be written and read by in the author and audience columns respectively.

### Ways of using MC+

Here are three ways that you can use the MC+ framework:

1. **Use it straight off-the-shelf**. You can download MC+ card templates and write information directly into these sheets. This is the simplest way to get started with MC+, and we suggest you try this before using it in other ways.
2. **Adapt it to create your own documentation tools**. You can use the MC+ framework as a foundation or reference point for your own AI documentation tools and initiatives. For example, you could:
    - Download and edit card templates directly to create versions of the MC+ framework to suit your context;
    - Create your own templates in a preferred filetype using the MC+ schemas;
    - Integrate MC+ schemas into dynamic solutions for information management such as system, model or data repositories.
3. **Use the design to inform your AI practices**. In addition to the information that MC+ aims to capture, the MC+ design offers you a holistic, easy-to-grasp model of the end-to-end activities within the AI production cycle. Employing a systems-thinking approach to AI policy can help you contextualise your activities and think through the interaction effects of your policies and practices.

MC+ is available under the Open Government License, so we encourage you to adapt the materials provided here or use them as inspiration for your organisationâ€™s AI policy. _See the Resources section for templates, schemas and the MC+ AI production cycle._

### Writing cards

We recommend that every card has a **lead author**. The lead author should be responsible for the overall writing and editing process, including collating all the information in the card, ensuring it is suitably accessible and useful for its intended audience and acting as the point of contact for questions about the card.

Completing an MC+ card will likely require the input of people with various roles, particularly for larger datasets, models and systems. Different roles will be suited for different sections. Borrowing from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-card-annotated), we can consider three broad categories of roles:

- **Developers** who write code, deliver training and testing, and create the technical products;
- **Appraisers** who offer perspective on the impact of the technology in the real-world (legal, social, ethical, or otherwise);
- **Project organisers** who are familiar with the overall scope and specifications of the technology.

Individuals may have more than role. The project organiser may be the most appropriate lead author in many cases.
