title: What types of technology does MC+ cover?
description: What types of technology does MC+ cover?

The current MC+ framework is flexible and intended to accommodate information about any machine learning system. It is suitable for all:

- **Methods of ML**, including supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning;
- **Model scales**, from simple regression models to multi-billion parameter transformers;
- **Data modalities**, including tabular, audio, video, image and time-series data;
- **Domains of system use**, which are extremely varied.

However, we acknowledge the trade-off between the broad scope of the framework and the consistency and utility of information it provides in specific contexts. Future development could involve creating modules or variants of MC+ cards to tailor them for different users. Therefore, we are interested in understanding the contexts in which the MC+ framework could better meet user needs.
