While the MC+ cards have been designed with interdependence and communication across the AI lifecycle in mind, other forms of ML documentation could potentially substitute each of the cards. For example, organisations with a proprietary model card commonly used by their developers may choose to retain their own form of model documentation and supplement it with MC+ dataset cards and/or system cards to achieve their AI governance goals.
