Each card corresponds to one named component of an AI system: a dataset, a trained model, or the system itself. Cards are split into sections that focus on one aspect of technology characteristics or practices. A complete list of thematic sections of the MC+ framework is presented in Table 3 below.

Table : List of MC+ card sections.

| Card | Sections | Exploration area |
