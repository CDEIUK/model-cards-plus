Cards are likely to be most valuable at points of exchange in the AI lifecycle, particularly before a new person or team begins using the technology that has been documented. Active use of MC+ during the development and pre-deployment processes provides the best opportunity for effective AI governance, including accurate logging and timely risk treatment. As such, we recommend that cards are completed and used sequentially during new AI development projects, with information about datasets being used to inform model training and testing, and information about trained models used to inform system use and management. An example of how MC+ could be employed across the breadth of the lifecycle is provided in [the Annex](#_Annex_A_-).

However, cards could also be completed retrospectively. This could be particularly useful if the technology is likely to be developed or distributed further.

Given the dynamic nature of many datasets, models and systems, card information may become outdated and require replacing or renewing. Currently, MC+ cards are offered as simple, static templates, meaning that changes to fields need to be made manually and make cards difficult to maintain as continually up-to-date documents. As a guideline for static cards, we suggest that a new card should be created with each major version update to the technology.

When writing a card, we recommend that one lead author oversees completion to ensure that information is consistent and thorough. However, any number of people could contribute to a card.
