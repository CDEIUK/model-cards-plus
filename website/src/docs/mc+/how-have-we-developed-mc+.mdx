The MC+ framework co-opts and extends the principles and characteristics of existing AI cards, and has been further shaped by related DSIT work, external regulatory frameworks and initiatives, and feedback from end-user testing.

Like ML documentation initiatives before, MC+ draws heavily from Google’s initial model and data card work, particularly their organising principles. Our MC+ framework make use of an intuitive ‘block’ layout for displaying data fields – where unit blocks consist of a field name, prompt and space for additional instructions—and aims to observe the [five principles](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531146.3533231#sec-11) that inform the design of the Google Data Card, rewritten in Table 1.

Table : five design principles for MC+, adapted from Google's Data Cards (Pushkarna et. al., 2022),

| **P1. Flexible**: describe a wide range of technologies. |
| --- |
| **P2. Modular**: organise documentation into meaningful sections that are self-contained and well-structured units. |
| **P3. Extensible**: components that can be easily reconfigured or extended systematically for novel technologies, analyses, and platforms. |
| **P4. Accessible**: represent content at multiple granularities so readers can efficiently find and effectively navigate detailed descriptions of the technology. |
| **P5. Content-agnostic**: support diverse media including multiple choice selections, long-form inputs, text, visualisations, images, code blocks, tables, and other interactive elements. |

The data fields of MC+ closely resemble fields in other cards, particularly those from Google and Hugging Face. Some are taken directly from other cards where useful categorisations have been established, and some are variants that have been updated to align with other initiatives or pre-empt development of more advanced digital MC+-related tools.

The MC+ framework has synergies with the UK’s [Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/algorithmic-transparency-recording-standard-hub) (ATRS): a communication framework that helps public sector organisations provide clear information about the algorithmic tools they use, and why they’re using them. The three-part structure of technical reporting is replicated in the ATRS framework, such that information provided by suppliers using MC+ cards could be easily ported into an ATRS record by a public body that has procured an AI system. MC+ is also a key part of DSIT’s current AI assurance work. It builds upon the [Introduction to AI Assurance,](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introduction-to-ai-assurance/introduction-to-ai-assurance) sits alongside the [AI Management Essentials](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ai-management-essentials-tool) tool currently under development following public consultation, and is likely to form part of the recently announced [AI Assurance Platform](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/assuring-a-responsible-future-for-ai/assuring-a-responsible-future-for-ai#action-1-ai-assurance-platform).

Analysis of the wider regulatory and assurance landscape have also shaped MC+ framework. While MC+ is a voluntary initiative, it aims to prepare businesses to engage with mandatory standards and regulations. As such, we have ensured that successful use of MC+ would equate to meaningful progress towards compliance with the technical documentation requirements of the [EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/annex/4/) and [ISO 42001](https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html). Industry initiatives that have influenced MC+ design to date include the TechWorks [Trustable AI Bill Of Materials (TAIBOM)](https://taibom.org/) project that aims to address the challenge of providing formal descriptions of AI systems and dependencies, and various AI governance platforms that demonstrate ways of recording and managing AI information in practice.

Finally, MC+ has undergone one major design iteration following two end-user testing workshops convened by the Ministry of Defence.
