Cards are short documents that contain information about aspects of machine learning (ML) systems. They generally follow a template divided into several standardised sections and data fields, providing users with boundaries for information input. The concept of a model card to accompany trained ML models was introduced by Google in 2018 with their [Model Cards for Model Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) framework. The motivation of their work was to increase transparency around model performance and limitations, and drew from similar documentation initiatives for datasets like [Datasheets for Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) and [Data Statements for Natural Language Processing](https://aclanthology.org/Q18-1041/).

These early initiatives inspired other organisations to create their own card-based documentation, widening the landscape of ML reporting artefacts and establishing new methods and framings for information capture. Prominent artefacts developed since 2018 include [Hugging Face’s Model Cards](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards), [Google’s Data Cards](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3531146.3533231), [IBM’s AI Factsheets 360](https://aifs360.res.ibm.com/), and [Meta’s System Cards](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/system-level-transparency-of-machine-learning/). Cards vary in their scope, technicality, intended users and subject matter, but generally focus on one of the three core technological components within the ML lifecycle: data, ML models, and ML systems. A brief history and non-exhaustive list of ML documentation tools has been [shared by Hugging Face researchers](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-card-landscape-analysis).

MC+ builds upon the excellent work in this space and is the first initiative that brings technical documentation for datasets, models and systems together into a single package. In doing so, it offers alternatives to existing cards and a wrap-around framing that aims to accommodate other ML documentation initiatives.
