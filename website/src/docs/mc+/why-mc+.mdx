The MC+ framework was developed by the UK’s Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) as a voluntary tool to promote good information governance across AI supply chains. Good information governance—including capturing and sharing dependable information about AI systems—is a vital precursor to other responsible AI initiatives:

1. **Managing risks**. Many risks associated with using AI systems can be traced back to and addressed at the development stage. By breaking down an AI system into its component parts and processes, MC+ could help enable more informed risk assessments, prompt more effective risk treatment, and lead to better outcomes.
2. **Tackling accountability challenges**. With AI systems being used to support decision-making across society, challenging questions about who takes responsibility for the consequences of AI-influenced decisions have emerged. By providing a simple end-to-end documentation framework spanning the AI lifecycle, MC+ could help provide a traceable chain of information ownership, and encourage users to reflect on the responsibilities they have in a broader context of AI delivery.
3. **Providing a foundation for technical assurance**: MC+ encourages developers to record the results of measurements and evaluations performed on datasets, models and systems. Each of these technologies are the subjects—or potential subjects—of standards, regulations and professional assessments that use measurements to define acceptable limits. By providing a focal point for AI evaluation and compliance efforts, MC+ could help industry to engage further with AI standards, regulations and professional assessments.
