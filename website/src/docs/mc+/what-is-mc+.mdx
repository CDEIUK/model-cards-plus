Model Cards Plus (MC+) is a three-part framework for capturing information about AI systems, AI models and datasets. It was developed by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and aims to support decision-makers by improving transparency and information management across the AI lifecycle. Altogether, MC+ can be used to build up thorough technical descriptions of AI, combining the knowledge of many people involved in the development and use of AI systems in a structured, accumulative way.

MC+ has three modular components:

- A **Dataset Card** for describing collections of data used to develop AI models.
- A **Model Card** for describing trained machine learning models.
- A **System Card** for describing the products, tools, applications or devices that utilise AI models.

MC+ has a technical focus, meaning that the cards are designed to be used primarily by developers, engineers and designers of AI systems. In addition, MC+ encourages users to consider technical information in a broader context through the lenses of intended use, risk and policy compliance. Cards have a range of possible audiences, both technical and non-technical, and could be used to provide valuable insights for AI technology customers, end users, managers, regulators and researchers.
