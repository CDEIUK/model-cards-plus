title: How much information does MC+ require?
description: How much information does MC+ require?

MC+ is designed to be modular, extensible and content agnostic, meaning that the amount of information contained within cards could vary significantly based on the organisational context they are being used in and the technical, social and regulatory complexity of the card subject. We do not specify lengths for text-based fields, but categorise them as broadly as: short (a few words), medium (a few sentences) and long (several sentences or paragraphs).

In addition, some long-text fields are appended with an option space for linking images, documents and web pages. These types of content could either replace or supplement a text response.

All fields are currently treated as optional in the framework except the fields in the first “overview” sections of each card which are required as the minimum basis of a valid card.
