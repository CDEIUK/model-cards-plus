description: How do the three MC+ cards work together?

MC+ has a modular design to reflect with the way in which the technical components of AI come together to produce an overall system. We can imagine a single AI system (e.g. Chat-GPT) being comprised of one or more models (e.g. GPT-3 and an RLHF model) that have been developed using one or more datasets (e.g. CommonCrawl, WebText2, etc.). Cards can be created for each named technological component, meaning that multiple model and dataset cards can sit ‘underneath’ a single AI system card. This modular framing is depicted in Figure 1.

Taking a broader view of an AI system lifecycle, we can see how MC+ cards aim to describe a wide array of activities and enable information flow across the development and deployment processes. A basic system diagram of the AI lifecycle is depicted in Figure 2, with brief explanations of the activities represented by arrows provided in the numbered list.



Figure : A system diagram of the AI lifecycle. The numbered arrows represent the following processes:

1. Data is collected or extracted from a physical or digital environment and assembled into computational artefacts called datasets.
2. Datasets are processed through machine learning algorithms that ‘learn’ to identify patterns in the data. The artefacts of this process are complex mathematical functions, also known as AI models.
3. Datasets are also used to validate and test how well AI models perform against certain metrics. The model outputs can be evaluated during and after model development to ensure the models perform acceptably.
4. The trained AI models are prepared for delivery and practical use by being packaged into a larger set of functional components, also known as an AI system.
5. Within a use case - a given set of operational conditions – the AI system is deployed by processing operational data from the environment into an output for further use.
6. The system output is used to inform decisions or policies that often go on to shape the broader environment from which data is collected.
